# SnakesAndLadders
The Snake Game is a classic game where you control a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The objective is to avoid running into walls or the snake's own body while collecting food items to score points. The game becomes progressively challenging as the snake grows longer, testing your reflexes and decision-making skills.
